🌦️ Weather App - Your Pocket Meteorologist

🚀 Embark on a meteorological journey with my weather app! This project is a culmination of my dedication to Flutter development. The app boasts two modes—light and dark—that seamlessly adapt to your device's theme, ensuring a visually comfortable experience.
🌐 Features:

    Dynamic Theme Switching: Effortlessly switch between light and dark modes, or let the app sync with your device's theme for an immersive visual experience.

    City Search: Curious about the weather in a specific city? Just type its name, and the app will fetch and display real-time weather data.

    Auto-location Service: With a simple tap of a button, discover the current weather in your location. Please note that the accuracy may vary, as this feature relies on a free API.

🌍 Global Connectivity:

    API-Based Location Services: Upon opening the app, it intuitively presents your current weather details using free API-based location services.

    Fallback Location Button: In case the API fails to recognize your current location, use the dedicated button for a manual refresh.

🛠️ Learning Experience:

I am a newbie in the vast realm of app development, and this project serves as my practice ground. Expect occasional quirks, but bear with me—I'm committed to continuous improvement.
🙏 Acknowledgment:

I acknowledge that free APIs may have limitations, and occasionally, your current location might not be recognized. I appreciate your understanding as I hone my skills in crafting this weather app.


🚀 Next Steps:

I am eager to receive feedback, suggestions, and collaboration opportunities. As I continue to explore Flutter's capabilities, I look forward to enhancing this app and making it an even more reliable weather companion.

Thank you for your understanding, and let's navigate the weather together! ☔🌤️🌈
